For a circle of radius r,
Area = pi*(r^2)
Circumference = 2*pi*r

For all values of radius r, the Area of circle is always greater than Circumference of circle except for the two cases mentioned below.

1. At radius r = 0;
For a circle with numerical value as 0, both Area and Circumference will be equal in value.

2. At radius r = 2;
For a circle with a numerical value of 2, both Area and Circumference will be equal in value.
